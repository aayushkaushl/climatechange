      <details>
        <summary>What causes climate change?</summary>
        <p>Climate change is primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to the warming of the Earth's climate.</p>
      </details>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <details>
        <summary>How does climate change affect weather patterns?</summary>
        <p>Climate change can influence weather patterns by causing shifts in temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather events. This may result in more frequent and intense heatwaves, storms, and changes in precipitation patterns.</p>
      </details>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <details>
        <summary>What is global warming?</summary>
        <p>Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature. It is a significant aspect of climate change, driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p>
      </details>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <details>
        <summary>How are oceans affected by climate change?</summary>
        <p>Oceans are impacted by climate change through rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and changes in ocean circulation. Melting ice caps contribute to sea-level rise, while increased carbon dioxide levels lead to ocean acidification.</p>
      </details>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <details>
        <summary>Are extreme weather events linked to climate change?</summary>
        <p>Yes, there is scientific evidence linking certain extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires to climate change. The changing climate can exacerbate the intensity and frequency of these events.</p>
      </details>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <details>
        <summary>What is the role of deforestation in climate change?</summary>
        <p>Deforestation contributes to climate change by reducing the number of trees that absorb carbon dioxide. Trees act as carbon sinks, and their removal increases greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.</p>
      </details>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <details>
        <summary>How can individuals contribute to mitigating climate change?</summary>
        <p>Individuals can contribute by adopting sustainable practices, reducing energy consumption, using public transportation, supporting renewable energy, and advocating for environmental policies. Small actions collectively make a significant impact.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <details>
        <summary>What are the effects of climate change on agriculture?</summary>
        <p>Climate change affects agriculture through shifts in temperature, precipitation patterns, and the frequency of extreme weather events. Changes in growing seasons, water availability, and pest dynamics pose challenges to global food production.</p>
      </details>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <details>
        <summary>How can countries work together to combat climate change?</summary>
        <p>International cooperation is crucial to address climate change. Countries can collaborate on emission reduction goals, share technology and resources, and participate in global initiatives such as the Paris Agreement to collectively combat climate change.</p>
